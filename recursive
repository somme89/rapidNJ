DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This  manual  page  documents the GNU version of ffiinndd.  GNU ffiinndd searches the directory tree rooted at each
       given file name by evaluating the given expression from left to right, according to the rules of precedence
       (see  section  OPERATORS), until the outcome is known (the left hand side is false for _a_n_d operations, true
       for _o_r), at which point ffiinndd moves on to the next file name.

       If you are using ffiinndd in an environment where security is important (for example if you  are  using  it  to
       search directories that are writable by other users), you should read the "Security Considerations" chapter
       of the findutils documentation, which is called FFiinnddiinngg FFiilleess and comes  with  findutils.    That  document
       also  includes  a  lot  more  detail and discussion than this manual page, so you may find it a more useful
       source of information.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The --HH, --LL and --PP options control the treatment of symbolic links.  Command-line arguments following  these
       are  taken  to  be  names of files or directories to be examined, up to the first argument that begins with
       `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any following arguments are taken to be the  expression
       describing  what  is  to  be  searched  for.   If no paths are given, the current directory is used.  If no
       expression is given, the expression --pprriinntt is used (but you should probably consider using --pprriinntt00 instead,
       anyway).

       This  manual page talks about `options' within the expression list.  These options control the behaviour of
       ffiinndd but are specified immediately after the last path name.  The five `real' options --HH, --LL, --PP, --DD and --OO
       must  appear  before  the first path name, if at all.  A double dash ---- can also be used to signal that any
       remaining arguments are not options (though ensuring that all start points begin with either `./' or `/' is
       generally safer if you use wildcards in the list of start points).

       -P     Never  follow symbolic links.  This is the default behaviour.  When ffiinndd examines or prints informa‐
              tion a file, and the file is a symbolic link, the information used shall be taken from  the  proper‐
              ties of the symbolic link itself.


       -L     Follow  symbolic  links.  When ffiinndd examines or prints information about files, the information used
              shall be taken from the properties of the file to which the link points, not from  the  link  itself
              (unless  it  is  a  broken  symbolic  link  or  ffiinndd is unable to examine the file to which the link
              points).  Use of this option implies --nnoolleeaaff.  If you later use the --PP option, --nnoolleeaaff will still be
              in  effect.   If  --LL  is  in  effect and ffiinndd discovers a symbolic link to a subdirectory during its
              search, the subdirectory pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.

              When the --LL option is in effect, the --ttyyppee predicate will always match against the type of the  file
              that  a  symbolic  link  points to rather than the link itself (unless the symbolic link is broken).
              Using --LL causes the --llnnaammee and --iillnnaammee predicates always to return false.


       -H     Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing the command line arguments.  When  ffiinndd  exam‐
              ines  or  prints information about files, the information used shall be taken from the properties of
              the symbolic link itself.   The only exception to this behaviour is when a  file  specified  on  the
              command  line is a symbolic link, and the link can be resolved.  For that situation, the information
              used is taken from whatever the link points to (that is, the link  is  followed).   The  information
              about  the  link  itself is used as a fallback if the file pointed to by the symbolic link cannot be
              examined.  If --HH is in effect and one of the paths specified on the command line is a symbolic  link
              to  a directory, the contents of that directory will be examined (though of course -maxdepth 0 would
              prevent this).

       If more than one of --HH, --LL and --PP is specified, each overrides the others; the last one  appearing  on  the
       command  line  takes  effect.   Since it is the default, the --PP option should be considered to be in effect
       unless either --HH or --LL is specified.

       GNU ffiinndd frequently stats files during the processing of the command line itself, before any searching  has
       begun.   These  options also affect how those arguments are processed.  Specifically, there are a number of
       tests that compare files listed on the command line against a file we are currently considering.   In  each
       case,  the  file specified on the command line will have been examined and some of its properties will have
       been saved.  If the named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the --PP option is in effect (or if neither --HH
       nor  --LL  were  specified), the information used for the comparison will be taken from the properties of the
       symbolic link.  Otherwise, it will be taken from the properties of the file the link points  to.   If  ffiinndd
       cannot follow the link (for example because it has insufficient privileges or the link points to a nonexis‐
       tent file) the properties of the link itself will be used.

       When the --HH or --LL ooppttiioonnss aarree iinn eeffffeecctt,, aannyy ssyymmbboolliicc lliinnkkss lliisstteedd as the argument of --nneewweerr will be deref‐
       erenced, and the timestamp will be taken from the file to which the symbolic link points.  The same consid‐
       eration applies to --nneewweerrXXYY, --aanneewweerr and --ccnneewweerr.

       The --ffoollllooww option has a similar effect to --LL, though it takes effect at the point where it  appears  (that
       is,  if  --LL is not used but --ffoollllooww is, any symbolic links appearing after --ffoollllooww on the command line will
       be dereferenced, and those before it will not).


       -D debugoptions
              Print diagnostic information; this can be helpful to diagnose problems with why ffiinndd  is  not  doing
              what  you  want.   The  list of debug options should be comma separated.  Compatibility of the debug
              options is not guaranteed between releases of  findutils.   For  a  complete  list  of  valid  debug
              options, see the output of ffiinndd --DD hheellpp.  Valid debug options include

              help   Explain the debugging options

              tree   Show the expression tree in its original and optimised form.

              stat   Print  messages as files are examined with the ssttaatt and llssttaatt system calls.  The ffiinndd program
                     tries to minimise such calls.

              opt    Prints diagnostic information relating to the optimisation of the expression tree; see the -O
                     option.

              rates  Prints a summary indicating how often each predicate succeeded or failed.

       -Olevel
              Enables query optimisation.   The ffiinndd program reorders tests to speed up execution while preserving
              the overall effect; that is, predicates with side effects are not reordered relative to each  other.
              The optimisations performed at each optimisation level are as follows.

              0      Equivalent to optimisation level 1.

              1      This is the default optimisation level and corresponds to the traditional behaviour.  Expres‐
                     sions are reordered so that tests based only on the names of files  (for  example  --nnaammee  and
                     --rreeggeexx) are performed first.

              2      Any --ttyyppee or --xxttyyppee tests are performed after any tests based only on the names of files, but
                     before any tests that require information from the inode.  On many modern versions  of  Unix,
                     file  types  are  returned  by  rreeaaddddiirr(()) and so these predicates are faster to evaluate than
                     predicates which need to stat the file first.

              3      At this optimisation level, the full cost-based query optimiser is  enabled.   The  order  of
                     tests is modified so that cheap (i.e. fast) tests are performed first and more expensive ones
                     are performed later, if necessary.  Within each cost band, predicates are  evaluated  earlier
                     or  later  according  to whether they are likely to succeed or not.  For --oo, predicates which
                     are likely to succeed are evaluated earlier, and for --aa, predicates which are likely to  fail
                     are evaluated earlier.

              The cost-based optimiser has a fixed idea of how likely any given test is to succeed.  In some cases
              the probability takes account of the specific nature of the test (for example, --ttyyppee ff is assumed to
              be  more  likely  to  succeed than --ttyyppee cc).  The cost-based optimiser is currently being evaluated.
              If it does not actually improve the performance of ffiinndd, it  will  be  removed  again.   Conversely,
              optimisations  that  prove to be reliable, robust and effective may be enabled at lower optimisation
              levels over time.  However, the default behaviour (i.e. optimisation level 1) will not be changed in
              the  4.3.x release series.  The findutils test suite runs all the tests on ffiinndd at each optimisation
              level and ensures that the result is the same.

EEXXPPRREESSSSIIOONNSS
       The expression is made up of options (which affect overall operation rather than the processing of  a  spe‐
       cific  file,  and  always return true), tests (which return a true or false value), and actions (which have
       side effects and return a true or false value), all separated by operators.   --aanndd  is  assumed  where  the
       operator is omitted.

       If  the  expression  contains  no actions other than --pprruunnee, --pprriinntt is performed on all files for which the
       expression is true.


   OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       All options always return true.  Except for --ddaayyssttaarrtt, --ffoollllooww  and  --rreeggeexxttyyppee,  the  options  affect  all
       tests,  including  tests  specified  before the option.  This is because the options are processed when the
       command line is parsed, while the tests don't do anything until files are examined.  The --ddaayyssttaarrtt, --ffoollllooww
       and  --rreeggeexxttyyppee  options are different in this respect, and have an effect only on tests which appear later
       in the command line.  Therefore, for clarity, it is best to place them at the beginning of the  expression.
       A warning is issued if you don't do this.


       -d     A synonym for -depth, for compatibility with FreeBSD, NetBSD, MacOS X and OpenBSD.


       -daystart
              Measure  times  (for  --aammiinn,  --aattiimmee,  --ccmmiinn, --ccttiimmee, --mmmmiinn, and --mmttiimmee) from the beginning of today
              rather than from 24 hours ago.  This option only affects tests which appear  later  on  the  command
              line.


       -depth Process  each  directory's  contents  before  the directory itself.  The -delete action also implies
              --ddeepptthh.


       -follow
              Deprecated; use the --LL option instead.  Dereference symbolic links.  Implies --nnoolleeaaff.   The  --ffoollllooww
              option  affects  only  those  tests  which appear after it on the command line.  Unless the --HH or --LL
              option has been specified, the position of the --ffoollllooww option changes the behaviour  of  the  --nneewweerr
              predicate;  any  files  listed  as  the argument of --nneewweerr will be dereferenced if they are symbolic
              links.  The same consideration applies to --nneewweerrXXYY, --aanneewweerr and --ccnneewweerr.  Similarly, the --ttyyppee pred‐
              icate  will always match against the type of the file that a symbolic link points to rather than the
              link itself.  Using --ffoollllooww causes the --llnnaammee aanndd --iillnnaammee predicates always to return false.


       -help, --help
              Print a summary of the command-line usage of ffiinndd and exit.


       -ignore_readdir_race
              Normally, ffiinndd will emit an error message when it fails to stat a file.  If you give this option and
              a  file  is deleted between the time ffiinndd reads the name of the file from the directory and the time
              it tries to stat the file, no error message will be issued.    This also applies to files or  direc‐
              tories  whose names are given on the command line.  This option takes effect at the time the command
              line is read, which means that you cannot search one part of the filesystem with this option on  and
              part  of  it  with this option off (if you need to do that, you will need to issue two ffiinndd commands
              instead, one with the option and one without it).


       -maxdepth _l_e_v_e_l_s
              Descend at most _l_e_v_e_l_s (a non-negative integer) levels of directories below the command  line  argu‐
              ments.  --mmaaxxddeepptthh 00
               means only apply the tests and actions to the command line arguments.


       -mindepth _l_e_v_e_l_s
              Do  not apply any tests or actions at levels less than _l_e_v_e_l_s (a non-negative integer).  --mmiinnddeepptthh 11
              means process all files except the command line arguments.


       -mount Don't descend directories on other filesystems.  An alternate name for --xxddeevv, for compatibility with
              some other versions of ffiinndd.


       -noignore_readdir_race
              Turns off the effect of --iiggnnoorree__rreeaaddddiirr__rraaccee.


       -noleaf
              Do  not  optimize  by  assuming that directories contain 2 fewer subdirectories than their hard link
              count.  This option is needed when searching filesystems that do not follow the Unix  directory-link
              convention,  such  as  CD-ROM or MS-DOS filesystems or AFS volume mount points.  Each directory on a
              normal Unix filesystem has at least 2 hard links: its name and its `.'   entry.   Additionally,  its
              subdirectories  (if any) each have a `..'  entry linked to that directory.  When ffiinndd is examining a
              directory, after it has statted 2 fewer subdirectories than the directory's  link  count,  it  knows
              that  the  rest  of  the entries in the directory are non-directories (`leaf' files in the directory
              tree).  If only the files' names need to be examined, there is no need to stat them;  this  gives  a
              significant increase in search speed.


       -regextype _t_y_p_e
              Changes  the  regular  expression syntax understood by --rreeggeexx and --iirreeggeexx tests which occur later on
              the command line.  Currently-implemented types are emacs (this is the  default),  posix-awk,  posix-
              basic, posix-egrep and posix-extended.


       -version, --version
              Print the ffiinndd version number and exit.


       -warn, -nowarn
              Turn  warning  messages  on or off.  These warnings apply only to the command line usage, not to any
              conditions that ffiinndd might encounter when it searches directories.   The  default  behaviour  corre‐
              sponds to --wwaarrnn if standard input is a tty, and to --nnoowwaarrnn otherwise.


       -xdev  Don't descend directories on other filesystems.


   TTEESSTTSS
       Some  tests, for example --nneewweerrXXYY and --ssaammeeffiillee, allow comparison between the file currently being examined
       and some reference file specified on the command line.  When these tests are used,  the  interpretation  of
       the  reference  file is determined by the options --HH, --LL and --PP and any previous --ffoollllooww, but the reference
       file is only examined once, at the time the command line is parsed.  If the reference file cannot be  exam‐
       ined (for example, the ssttaatt(2) system call fails for it), an error message is issued, and ffiinndd exits with a
       nonzero status.

       Numeric arguments can be specified as

       _+_n     for greater than _n,

       _-_n     for less than _n,

       _n      for exactly _n.

       -amin _n
              File was last accessed _n minutes ago.


       -anewer _f_i_l_e
              File was last accessed more recently than _f_i_l_e was modified.  If _f_i_l_e is a symbolic link and the  --HH
              option or the --LL option is in effect, the access time of the file it points to is always used.


       -atime _n
              File  was last accessed _n*24 hours ago.  When find figures out how many 24-hour periods ago the file
              was last accessed, any fractional part is ignored, so to match --aattiimmee ++11, a file has  to  have  been
              accessed at least _t_w_o days ago.


       -cmin _n
              File's status was last changed _n minutes ago.


       -cnewer _f_i_l_e
              File's status was last changed more recently than _f_i_l_e was modified.  If _f_i_l_e is a symbolic link and
              the --HH option or the --LL option is in effect, the status-change time of the  file  it  points  to  is
              always used.


       -ctime _n
              File's status was last changed _n*24 hours ago.  See the comments for --aattiimmee to understand how round‐
              ing affects the interpretation of file status change times.


       -empty File is empty and is either a regular file or a directory.


       -executable
              Matches files which are executable and directories which are searchable (in a file  name  resolution
              sense).   This  takes  into  account  access control lists and other permissions artefacts which the
              --ppeerrmm test ignores.  This test makes use of the aacccceessss(2) system call, and so can be fooled  by  NFS
              servers  which  do  UID  mapping  (or root-squashing), since many systems implement aacccceessss(2) in the
              client's kernel and so cannot make use of the UID mapping information held on the  server.   Because
              this  test  is  based  only on the result of the aacccceessss(2) system call, there is no guarantee that a
              file for which this test succeeds can actually be executed.


       -false Always false.


       -fstype _t_y_p_e
              File is on a filesystem of type _t_y_p_e.  The valid filesystem types vary among different  versions  of
              Unix;  an  incomplete  list of filesystem types that are accepted on some version of Unix or another
              is: ufs, 4.2, 4.3, nfs, tmp, mfs, S51K, S52K.  You can use --pprriinnttff with the %F directive to see  the
              types of your filesystems.


       -gid _n File's numeric group ID is _n.


       -group _g_n_a_m_e
              File belongs to group _g_n_a_m_e (numeric group ID allowed).


       -ilname _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              Like  --llnnaammee,  but  the  match  is  case  insensitive.  If the --LL option or the --ffoollllooww option is in
              effect, this test returns false unless the symbolic link is broken.


       -iname _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              Like --nnaammee, but the match is case insensitive.  For example, the patterns `fo*' and `F??' match  the
              file  names  `Foo',  `FOO', `foo', `fOo', etc.   In these patterns, unlike filename expansion by the
              shell, an initial '.' can be matched by `*'.  That is, ffiinndd --nnaammee **bbaarr will match  the  file  `.foo‐
              bar'.    Please  note that you should quote patterns as a matter of course, otherwise the shell will
              expand any wildcard characters in them.


       -inum _n
              File has inode number _n.  It is normally easier to use the --ssaammeeffiillee test instead.


       -ipath _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              Behaves in the same way as --iiwwhhoolleennaammee.  This option is deprecated, so please do not use it.


       -iregex _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              Like --rreeggeexx, but the match is case insensitive.


       -iwholename _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              Like --wwhhoolleennaammee, but the match is case insensitive.


       -links _n
              File has _n links.


       -lname _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              File is a symbolic link whose contents match shell pattern _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  The metacharacters do not treat
              `/'  or `.' specially.  If the --LL option or the --ffoollllooww option is in effect, this test returns false
              unless the symbolic link is broken.


       -mmin _n
              File's data was last modified _n minutes ago.


       -mtime _n
              File's data was last modified _n*24 hours ago.  See the comments for --aattiimmee to understand how  round‐
              ing affects the interpretation of file modification times.


       -name _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              Base  of  file  name  (the path with the leading directories removed) matches shell pattern _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.
              The metacharacters (`*', `?', and `[]') match a `.' at the start of the base name (this is a  change
              in  findutils-4.2.2;  see section STANDARDS CONFORMANCE below).  To ignore a directory and the files
              under it, use --pprruunnee; see an example in the description of --ppaatthh.   Braces  are  not  recognised  as
              being  special, despite the fact that some shells including Bash imbue braces with a special meaning
              in shell patterns.  The filename matching is performed with the use of the ffnnmmaattcchh(3) library  func‐
              tion.    Don't  forget to enclose the pattern in quotes in order to protect it from expansion by the
              shell.


       -newer _f_i_l_e
              File was modified more recently than _f_i_l_e.  If _f_i_l_e is a symbolic link and the --HH option or  the  --LL
              option is in effect, the modification time of the file it points to is always used.


       -newerXY _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e
              Compares  the  timestamp of the current file with _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e.  The _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e argument is normally the
              name of a file (and one of its timestamps is used for the comparison) but it may also  be  a  string
              describing  an  absolute time.  _X and _Y are placeholders for other letters, and these letters select
              which time belonging to how _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e is used for the comparison.

              a   The access time of the file _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e
              B   The birth time of the file _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e
              c   The inode status change time of _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e
              m   The modification time of the file _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e
              t   _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e is interpreted directly as a time

              Some combinations are invalid; for example, it is invalid for _X to be _t.  Some combinations are  not
              implemented  on all systems; for example _B is not supported on all systems.  If an invalid or unsup‐
              ported combination of _X_Y is specified, a fatal error results.  Time specifications  are  interpreted
              as  for  the argument to the --dd option of GNU ddaattee.  If you try to use the birth time of a reference
              file, and the birth time cannot be determined, a fatal error message results.  If you specify a test
              which  refers to the birth time of files being examined, this test will fail for any files where the
              birth time is unknown.


       -nogroup
              No group corresponds to file's numeric group ID.


       -nouser
              No user corresponds to file's numeric user ID.


       -path _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              File name matches shell pattern _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  The metacharacters do not treat `/' or `.' specially;  so,
              for example,
                        find . -path "./sr*sc"
              will  print  an entry for a directory called `./src/misc' (if one exists).  To ignore a whole direc‐
              tory tree, use --pprruunnee rather than checking every file in the tree.  For example, to skip the  direc‐
              tory  `src/emacs'  and  all  files  and directories under it, and print the names of the other files
              found, do something like this:
                        find . -path ./src/emacs -prune -o -print
              Note that the pattern match test applies to the whole file name, starting  from  one  of  the  start
              points named on the command line.  It would only make sense to use an absolute path name here if the
              relevant start point is also an absolute path.  This means that this command will never  match  any‐
              thing:
                        find bar -path /foo/bar/myfile -print
              The  predicate  --ppaatthh  is  also  supported by HP-UX ffiinndd and will be in a forthcoming version of the
              POSIX standard.


       -perm _m_o_d_e
              File's permission bits are exactly _m_o_d_e (octal or symbolic).  Since an exact match is  required,  if
              you  want to use this form for symbolic modes, you may have to specify a rather complex mode string.
              For example --ppeerrmm gg==ww will only match files which have mode 0020 (that  is,  ones  for  which  group
              write  permission  is the only permission set).  It is more likely that you will want to use the `/'
              or `-' forms, for example --ppeerrmm --gg==ww, which matches any file with group write permission.   See  the
              EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS section for some illustrative examples.


       -perm -_m_o_d_e
              All of the permission bits _m_o_d_e are set for the file.  Symbolic modes are accepted in this form, and
              this is usually the way in which would want to use them.  You must specify `u', `g' or  `o'  if  you
              use a symbolic mode.   See the EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS section for some illustrative examples.


       -perm /_m_o_d_e
              Any  of  the  permission  bits _m_o_d_e are set for the file.  Symbolic modes are accepted in this form.
              You must specify `u', `g' or `o' if you use a symbolic mode.  See  the  EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS  section  for  some
              illustrative  examples.  If no permission bits in _m_o_d_e are set, this test matches any file (the idea
              here is to be consistent with the behaviour of --ppeerrmm --000000).


       -perm +_m_o_d_e
              Deprecated, old way of searching for files with any of the permission bits in _m_o_d_e set.  You  should
              use  --ppeerrmm  _/_m_o_d_e  instead.  Trying  to use the `+' syntax with symbolic modes will yield surprising
              results.  For example, `+u+x' is a valid symbolic mode (equivalent to +u,+x,  i.e.  0111)  and  will
              therefore  not be evaluated as --ppeerrmm ++_m_o_d_e but instead as the exact mode specifier --ppeerrmm _m_o_d_e and so
              it matches files with exact permissions 0111 instead of files with any  execute  bit  set.   If  you
              found  this  paragraph  confusing,  you're not alone - just use --ppeerrmm //_m_o_d_e.  This form of the --ppeerrmm
              test is deprecated because the POSIX specification requires the interpretation of a leading  `+'  as
              being part of a symbolic mode, and so we switched to using `/' instead.


       -readable
              Matches  files  which  are readable.  This takes into account access control lists and other permis‐
              sions artefacts which the --ppeerrmm test ignores.  This test makes use of the aacccceessss(2) system call, and
              so  can be fooled by NFS servers which do UID mapping (or root-squashing), since many systems imple‐
              ment aacccceessss(2) in the client's kernel and so cannot make use of the UID mapping information held  on
              the server.


       -regex _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              File name matches regular expression _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  This is a match on the whole path, not a search.  For
              example, to match a file named `./fubar3', you can use the regular expression `.*bar.' or  `.*b.*3',
              but  not  `f.*r3'.   The regular expressions understood by ffiinndd are by default Emacs Regular Expres‐
              sions, but this can be changed with the --rreeggeexxttyyppee option.


       -samefile _n_a_m_e
              File refers to the same inode as _n_a_m_e.   When --LL is in effect, this can include symbolic links.


       -size _n[cwbkMG]
              File uses _n units of space.  The following suffixes can be used:

              `b'    for 512-byte blocks (this is the default if no suffix is used)

              `c'    for bytes

              `w'    for two-byte words

              `k'    for Kilobytes (units of 1024 bytes)

              `M'    for Megabytes (units of 1048576 bytes)

              `G'    for Gigabytes (units of 1073741824 bytes)

              The size does not count indirect blocks, but it does count blocks in sparse files that are not actu‐
              ally  allocated.   Bear  in  mind  that the `%k' and `%b' format specifiers of --pprriinnttff handle sparse
              files differently.  The `b' suffix always denotes 512-byte blocks and never 1 Kilobyte blocks, which
              is different to the behaviour of --llss.


       -true  Always true.


       -type _c
              File is of type _c:

              b      block (buffered) special

              c      character (unbuffered) special

              d      directory

              p      named pipe (FIFO)

              f      regular file

              l      symbolic link; this is never true if the --LL option or the --ffoollllooww option is in effect, unless
                     the symbolic link is broken.  If you want to search for symbolic links when --LL is in  effect,
                     use --xxttyyppee.

              s      socket

              D      door (Solaris)

       -uid _n File's numeric user ID is _n.


       -used _n
              File was last accessed _n days after its status was last changed.


       -user _u_n_a_m_e
              File is owned by user _u_n_a_m_e (numeric user ID allowed).


       -wholename _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              See -path.    This alternative is less portable than --ppaatthh.


       -writable
              Matches  files  which  are writable.  This takes into account access control lists and other permis‐
              sions artefacts which the --ppeerrmm test ignores.  This test makes use of the aacccceessss(2) system call, and
              so  can be fooled by NFS servers which do UID mapping (or root-squashing), since many systems imple‐
              ment aacccceessss(2) in the client's kernel and so cannot make use of the UID mapping information held  on
              the server.


       -xtype _c
              The  same  as  --ttyyppee unless the file is a symbolic link.  For symbolic links: if the --HH or --PP option
              was specified, true if the file is a link to a file of type _c; if the --LL option has been given, true
              if _c is `l'.  In other words, for symbolic links, --xxttyyppee checks the type of the file that --ttyyppee does
              not check.


   AACCTTIIOONNSS
       -delete
              Delete files; true if removal succeeded.  If the removal failed, an error  message  is  issued.   If
              --ddeelleettee  fails, ffiinndd's exit status will be nonzero (when it eventually exits).  Use of --ddeelleettee auto‐
              matically turns on the --ddeepptthh option.

              WWaarrnniinnggss: Don't forget that the find command line is evaluated as an expression, so putting  --ddeelleettee
              first will make ffiinndd try to delete everything below the starting points you specified.  When testing
              a ffiinndd command line that you later intend to use with --ddeelleettee, you should explicitly specify  --ddeepptthh
              in  order  to avoid later surprises.  Because --ddeelleettee implies --ddeepptthh, you cannot usefully use --pprruunnee
              and --ddeelleettee together.


       -exec _c_o_m_m_a_n_d ;
              Execute _c_o_m_m_a_n_d; true if 0 status is returned.  All following arguments to  ffiinndd  are  taken  to  be
              arguments  to  the  command  until an argument consisting of `;' is encountered.  The string `{}' is
              replaced by the current file name being processed everywhere it occurs in the arguments to the  com‐
              mand, not just in arguments where it is alone, as in some versions of ffiinndd.  Both of these construc‐
              tions might need to be escaped (with a `\') or quoted to protect them from expansion by  the  shell.
              See  the EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS section for examples of the use of the --eexxeecc option.  The specified command is run
              once for each matched file.  The command is executed in the starting directory.   There are unavoid‐
              able  security  problems  surrounding  use  of  the --eexxeecc action; you should use the --eexxeeccddiirr option
              instead.


       -exec _c_o_m_m_a_n_d {} +
              This variant of the --eexxeecc action runs the specified command on the selected files, but  the  command
              line  is  built  by appending each selected file name at the end; the total number of invocations of
              the command will be much less than the number of matched files.  The command line is built  in  much
              the  same  way that xxaarrggss builds its command lines.  Only one instance of `{}' is allowed within the
              command.  The command is executed in the starting directory.


       -execdir _c_o_m_m_a_n_d ;

       -execdir _c_o_m_m_a_n_d {} +
              Like --eexxeecc, but the specified command is run from the  subdirectory  containing  the  matched  file,
              which  is  not normally the directory in which you started ffiinndd.  This a much more secure method for
              invoking commands, as it avoids race conditions during resolution of the paths to the matched files.
              As  with  the  --eexxeecc action, the `+' form of --eexxeeccddiirr will build a command line to process more than
              one matched file, but any given invocation of _c_o_m_m_a_n_d will only list files that exist  in  the  same
              subdirectory.  If you use this option, you must ensure that your $$PPAATTHH environment variable does not
              reference `.'; otherwise, an attacker can run any commands they like by  leaving  an  appropriately-
              named  file  in  a  directory in which you will run --eexxeeccddiirr.  The same applies to having entries in
              $$PPAATTHH which are empty or which are not absolute directory names.


       -fls _f_i_l_e
              True; like --llss but write to _f_i_l_e like --ffpprriinntt.  The output file is always created, even if the pred‐
              icate is never matched.  See the UUNNUUSSUUAALL FFIILLEENNAAMMEESS section for information about how unusual charac‐
              ters in filenames are handled.


       -fprint _f_i_l_e
              True; print the full file name into file _f_i_l_e.  If _f_i_l_e does not exist when ffiinndd is run, it is  cre‐
              ated;  if  it  does  exist, it is truncated.  The file names ``/dev/stdout'' and ``/dev/stderr'' are
              handled specially; they refer to the standard output and standard error output,  respectively.   The
              output  file  is  always created, even if the predicate is never matched.  See the UUNNUUSSUUAALL FFIILLEENNAAMMEESS
              section for information about how unusual characters in filenames are handled.


       -fprint0 _f_i_l_e
              True; like --pprriinntt00 but write to _f_i_l_e like --ffpprriinntt.  The output file is always created, even  if  the
              predicate  is  never  matched.   See the UUNNUUSSUUAALL FFIILLEENNAAMMEESS section for information about how unusual
              characters in filenames are handled.


       -fprintf _f_i_l_e _f_o_r_m_a_t
              True; like --pprriinnttff but write to _f_i_l_e like --ffpprriinntt.  The output file is always created, even  if  the
              predicate  is  never  matched.   See the UUNNUUSSUUAALL FFIILLEENNAAMMEESS section for information about how unusual
              characters in filenames are handled.


       -ls    True; list current file in llss --ddiillss format on standard output.  The block counts are of  1K  blocks,
              unless the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, in which case 512-byte blocks are used.  See
              the UUNNUUSSUUAALL FFIILLEENNAAMMEESS section for information about how unusual characters in filenames are handled.


       -ok _c_o_m_m_a_n_d ;
              Like --eexxeecc but ask the user first.  If the user agrees, run  the  command.   Otherwise  just  return
              false.  If the command is run, its standard input is redirected from //ddeevv//nnuullll.


              The response to the prompt is matched against a pair of regular expressions to determine if it is an
              affirmative or negative response.  This regular expression  is  obtained  from  the  system  if  the
              `POSIXLY_CORRECT'  environment  variable  is set, or otherwise from ffiinndd's message translations.  If
              the system has no suitable definition, ffiinndd's own definition will be used.    In  either  case,  the
              interpretation  of  the  regular  expression  itself  will  be affected by the environment variables
              'LC_CTYPE' (character classes) and 'LC_COLLATE' (character ranges and equivalence classes).




       -okdir _c_o_m_m_a_n_d ;
              Like --eexxeeccddiirr but ask the user first in the same way as for --ookk.  If the user does not  agree,  just
              return false.  If the command is run, its standard input is redirected from //ddeevv//nnuullll.


       -print True;  print  the  full file name on the standard output, followed by a newline.   If you are piping
              the output of ffiinndd into another program and there is the faintest possibility that the  files  which
              you  are searching for might contain a newline, then you should seriously consider using the --pprriinntt00
              option instead of --pprriinntt.  See the UUNNUUSSUUAALL FFIILLEENNAAMMEESS section for information about how unusual char‐
              acters in filenames are handled.


       -print0
              True;  print the full file name on the standard output, followed by a null character (instead of the
              newline character that --pprriinntt uses).  This allows file names that contain newlines or other types of
              white  space to be correctly interpreted by programs that process the ffiinndd output.  This option cor‐
              responds to the --00 option of xxaarrggss.


       -printf _f_o_r_m_a_t
              True; print _f_o_r_m_a_t on the standard output, interpreting  `\'  escapes  and  `%'  directives.   Field
              widths  and  precisions  can be specified as with the `printf' C function.  Please note that many of
              the fields are printed as %s rather than %d, and this may mean that flags don't work  as  you  might
              expect.   This also means that the `-' flag does work (it forces fields to be left-aligned).  Unlike
              --pprriinntt, --pprriinnttff does not add a newline at the end of the string.  The escapes and directives are:

              \a     Alarm bell.

              \b     Backspace.

              \c     Stop printing from this format immediately and flush the output.

              \f     Form feed.

              \n     Newline.

              \r     Carriage return.

              \t     Horizontal tab.

              \v     Vertical tab.

              \0     ASCII NUL.

              \\     A literal backslash (`\').

              \NNN   The character whose ASCII code is NNN (octal).

              A `\' character followed by any other character is treated as an ordinary character,  so  they  both
              are printed.

              %%     A literal percent sign.

              %a     File's last access time in the format returned by the C `ctime' function.

              %A_k    File's  last access time in the format specified by _k, which is either `@' or a directive for
                     the C `strftime' function.  The possible values for _k are listed below; some  of  them  might
                     not be available on all systems, due to differences in `strftime' between systems.

                            ting the TZ environment variable).  The seconds field includes a fractional part.

              %b     The amount of disk space used for this file in 512-byte blocks. Since disk space is allocated
                     in multiples of the filesystem block size this is usually greater than  %s/512,  but  it  can
                     also be smaller if the file is a sparse file.

              %c     File's last status change time in the format returned by the C `ctime' function.

              %C_k    File's last status change time in the format specified by _k, which is the same as for %A.

              %d     File's depth in the directory tree; 0 means the file is a command line argument.

              %D     The device number on which the file exists (the st_dev field of struct stat), in decimal.

              %f     File's name with any leading directories removed (only the last element).

              %F     Type of the filesystem the file is on; this value can be used for -fstype.

              %g     File's group name, or numeric group ID if the group has no name.

              %G     File's numeric group ID.

              %h     Leading  directories of file's name (all but the last element).  If the file name contains no
                     slashes (since it is in the current directory) the %h specifier expands to ".".

              %H     Command line argument under which file was found.

              %i     File's inode number (in decimal).

              %k     The amount of disk space used for this file in 1K blocks. Since disk space  is  allocated  in
                     multiples  of the filesystem block size this is usually greater than %s/1024, but it can also
                     be smaller if the file is a sparse file.

              %l     Object of symbolic link (empty string if file is not a symbolic link).

              %m     File's permission bits (in octal).  This option uses the  `traditional'  numbers  which  most
                     Unix  implementations  use, but if your particular implementation uses an unusual ordering of
                     octal permissions bits, you will see a difference between the actual value of the file's mode
                     and  the output of %m.   Normally you will want to have a leading zero on this number, and to
                     do this, you should use the ## flag (as in, for example, `%#m').

              %M     File's permissions (in symbolic form, as for llss).  This directive is supported  in  findutils
                     4.2.5 and later.

              %n     Number of hard links to file.

              %p     File's name.

              %P     File's name with the name of the command line argument under which it was found removed.

              %s     File's size in bytes.

              %S     File's  sparseness.   This is calculated as (BLOCKSIZE*st_blocks / st_size).  The exact value
                     you will get for an ordinary file of a certain length is system-dependent.  However, normally
                     sparse  files  will have values less than 1.0, and files which use indirect blocks may have a
                     value which is greater than 1.0.   The value used for BLOCKSIZE is system-dependent,  but  is
                     usually  512  bytes.    If the file size is zero, the value printed is undefined.  On systems
                     which lack support for st_blocks, a file's sparseness is assumed to be 1.0.

              %t     File's last modification time in the format returned by the C `ctime' function.

              %T_k    File's last modification time in the format specified by _k, which is the same as for %A.

              %u     File's user name, or numeric user ID if the user has no name.

              %U     File's numeric user ID.

              %y     File's type (like in llss --ll), U=unknown type (shouldn't happen)

              %Y     File's type (like %y), plus follow symlinks: L=loop, N=nonexistent

              A `%' character followed by any other character is discarded, but the  other  character  is  printed
              (don't  rely on this, as further format characters may be introduced).  A `%' at the end of the for‐
              mat argument causes undefined behaviour since there is no following character.  In some locales,  it
              may  hide  your door keys, while in others it may remove the final page from the novel you are read‐
              ing.

              The %m and %d directives support the ## , 00 and ++ flags, but the other directives  do  not,  even  if
              they print numbers.  Numeric directives that do not support these flags include GG, UU, bb, DD, kk and nn.
              The `-' format flag is supported and changes the alignment of a field from right-justified (which is
              the default) to left-justified.

              See the UUNNUUSSUUAALL FFIILLEENNAAMMEESS section for information about how unusual characters in filenames are han‐
              dled.



       -prune True; if the file is a directory, do not descend into it. If --ddeepptthh  is  given,  false;  no  effect.
              Because --ddeelleettee implies --ddeepptthh, you cannot usefully use --pprruunnee and --ddeelleettee ttooggeetthheerr..


       -quit  Exit  immediately.  No child processes will be left running, but no more paths specified on the com‐
              mand line will be processed.  For example, ffiinndd //ttmmpp//ffoooo  //ttmmpp//bbaarr  --pprriinntt  --qquuiitt  will  print  only
              //ttmmpp//ffoooo.   Any command lines which have been built up with --eexxeeccddiirr ...... {{}} ++ will be invoked before
              ffiinndd exits.   The exit status may or may not be zero, depending on  whether  an  error  has  already
              occurred.


   UUNNUUSSUUAALL FFIILLEENNAAMMEESS
       Many of the actions of ffiinndd result in the printing of data which is under the control of other users.  This
       includes file names, sizes, modification times and so forth.  File names are a potential problem since they
       can  contain  any  character  except  `\0' and `/'.  Unusual characters in file names can do unexpected and
       often undesirable things to your terminal (for example, changing the settings of your function keys on some
       terminals).  Unusual characters are handled differently by various actions, as described below.


       -print0, -fprint0
              Always print the exact filename, unchanged, even if the output is going to a terminal.


       -ls, -fls
              Unusual  characters  are  always  escaped.   White space, backslash, and double quote characters are
              printed using C-style escaping (for example `\f', `\"').  Other unusual characters are printed using
              an  octal  escape.   Other  printable  characters (for --llss and --ffllss these are the characters between
              octal 041 and 0176) are printed as-is.


       -printf, -fprintf
              If the output is not going to a terminal, it is printed as-is.  Otherwise,  the  result  depends  on
              which directive is in use.  The directives %D, %F, %g, %G, %H, %Y, and %y expand to values which are
              not under control of files' owners, and so are printed as-is.  The directives %a, %b,  %c,  %d,  %i,
              %k, %m, %M, %n, %s, %t, %u and %U have values which are under the control of files' owners but which
              cannot be used to send arbitrary data to the terminal, and so these are printed as-is.   The  direc‐
              tives  %f,  %h,  %l, %p and %P are quoted.  This quoting is performed in the same way as for GNU llss.
              This is not the same quoting mechanism as the one used for --llss and --ffllss.  If you are able to  decide
              what  format  to  use  for the output of ffiinndd then it is normally better to use `\0' as a terminator
              than to use newline, as file names can contain white space and newline characters.  The  setting  of
              the `LC_CTYPE' environment variable is used to determine which characters need to be quoted.


       -print, -fprint
              Quoting  is  handled in the same way as for --pprriinnttff and --ffpprriinnttff.  If you are using ffiinndd in a script
              or in a situation where the matched files might have arbitrary  names,  you  should  consider  using
              --pprriinntt00 instead of --pprriinntt.

       The --ookk and --ookkddiirr actions print the current filename as-is.  This may change in a future release.


   OOPPEERRAATTOORRSS
       Listed in order of decreasing precedence:


       ( _e_x_p_r )
              Force precedence.  Since parentheses are special to the shell, you will normally need to quote them.
              Many of the examples in this manual page use backslashes for  this  purpose:  `\(...\)'  instead  of
              `(...)'.


       ! _e_x_p_r True  if _e_x_p_r is false.  This character will also usually need protection from interpretation by the
              shell.

              Two expressions in a row are taken to be joined with an implied "and"; _e_x_p_r_2  is  not  evaluated  if

              list is the value of _e_x_p_r_2. The comma operator can be useful for  searching  for  several  different
              types  of thing, but traversing the filesystem hierarchy only once.  The --ffpprriinnttff action can be used
              to list the various matched items into several different output files.



SSTTAANNDDAARRDDSS CCOONNFFOORRMMAANNCCEE
       For closest compliance to the POSIX standard, you should set the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable.  The
       following options are specified in the POSIX standard (IEEE Std 1003.1, 2003 Edition):


       --HH     This option is supported.


       --LL     This option is supported.


       --nnaammee  This  option  is  supported,  but POSIX conformance depends on the POSIX conformance of the system's
              ffnnmmaattcchh(3) library function.  As of findutils-4.2.2, shell metacharacters  (`*',  `?'  or  `[]'  for
              example)  will  match a leading `.', because IEEE PASC interpretation 126 requires this.   This is a
              change from previous versions of findutils.


       --ttyyppee  Supported.   POSIX specifies `b', `c', `d', `l', `p', `f' and `s'.  GNU find also supports `D', rep‐
              resenting a Door, where the OS provides these.


       --ookk    Supported.   Interpretation  of the response is according to the "yes" and "no" patterns selected by
              setting the `LC_MESSAGES' environment variable.  When the `POSIXLY_CORRECT' environment variable  is
              set, these patterns are taken system's definition of a positive (yes) or negative (no) response. See
              the  system's  documentation  for  nnll__llaannggiinnffoo(3),  in  particular  YESEXPR  and   NOEXPR.      When
              `POSIXLY_CORRECT' is not set, the patterns are instead taken from ffiinndd's own message catalogue.


       --nneewweerr Supported.   If  the file specified is a symbolic link, it is always dereferenced.  This is a change
              from previous behaviour, which used to take the relevant time from the symbolic link; see  the  HIS‐
              TORY section below.


       --ppeerrmm  Supported.  If the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable is not set, some mode arguments (for example
              +a+x) which are not valid in POSIX are supported for backward-compatibility.


       Other predicates
              The predicates --aattiimmee, --ccttiimmee, --ddeepptthh, --ggrroouupp, --lliinnkkss, --mmttiimmee, --nnooggrroouupp,  --nnoouusseerr,  --pprriinntt,  --pprruunnee,
              --ssiizzee, --uusseerr and --xxddeevv are all supported.


       The POSIX standard specifies parentheses `(', `)', negation `!' and the `and' and `or' operators ( --aa, --oo).

       All  other options, predicates, expressions and so forth are extensions beyond the POSIX standard.  Many of
       these extensions are not unique to GNU find, however.

       The POSIX standard requires that ffiinndd detects loops:

              The ffiinndd utility shall detect infinite loops; that is, entering a previously visited directory  that
              is  an  ancestor  of the last file encountered. When it detects an infinite loop, find shall write a
              diagnostic message to standard error and shall either recover its position in the hierarchy or  ter‐
              minate.

       GNU  ffiinndd  complies with these requirements.  The link count of directories which contain entries which are
       hard links to an ancestor will often be lower than they otherwise should be.  This can mean that  GNU  find
       will sometimes optimise away the visiting of a subdirectory which is actually a link to an ancestor.  Since
       ffiinndd does not actually enter such a subdirectory, it is allowed to avoid  emitting  a  diagnostic  message.
       Although this behaviour may be somewhat confusing, it is unlikely that anybody actually depends on this be‐
       haviour.  If the leaf optimisation has been turned off with --nnoolleeaaff, the directory  entry  will  always  be
       examined  and the diagnostic message will be issued where it is appropriate.  Symbolic links cannot be used
       to create filesystem cycles as such, but if the --LL option or the --ffoollllooww option is  in  use,  a  diagnostic
       message  is issued when ffiinndd encounters a loop of symbolic links.  As with loops containing hard links, the
       leaf optimisation will often mean that ffiinndd knows that it doesn't need to call _s_t_a_t_(_)  or  _c_h_d_i_r_(_)  on  the
       symbolic link, so this diagnostic is frequently not necessary.

       The --dd option is supported for compatibility with various BSD systems, but you should use the POSIX-compli‐
       ant option --ddeepptthh instead.

       The POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable does not affect the behaviour  of  the  --rreeggeexx  or  --iirreeggeexx  tests
       because those tests aren't specified in the POSIX standard.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS
       LANG   Provides a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null.


       LC_ALL If  set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization vari‐
              ables.


       LC_COLLATE
              The POSIX standard specifies that this variable affects the pattern matching  to  be  used  for  the
              --nnaammee  option.    GNU  find  uses  the  ffnnmmaattcchh(3) library function, and so support for `LC_COLLATE'
              depends on the system library.    This variable also affects the interpretation of the  response  to
              --ookk;;  while  the `LC_MESSAGES' variable selects the actual pattern used to interpret the response to
              --ookk, the interpretation of any bracket expressions in the pattern will be affected by `LC_COLLATE'.


       LC_CTYPE
              This variable affects the treatment of character classes used in regular expressions and  also  with
              the  --nnaammee  test,  if  the  system's  ffnnmmaattcchh(3) library function supports this.  This variable also
              affects the interpretation of any character classes in the regular expressions used to interpret the
              response  to  the  prompt issued by --ookk.  The `LC_CTYPE' environment variable will also affect which
              characters are considered to be unprintable when filenames are  printed;  see  the  section  UNUSUAL
              FILENAMES.


       LC_MESSAGES
              Determines  the locale to be used for internationalised messages.  If the `POSIXLY_CORRECT' environ‐
              ment variable is set, this also determines the interpretation of the response to the prompt made  by
              the --ookk action.


       NLSPATH
              Determines the location of the internationalisation message catalogues.


       PATH   Affects  the  directories which are searched to find the executables invoked by --eexxeecc, --eexxeeccddiirr, --ookk
              and --ookkddiirr.


       POSIXLY_CORRECT
              Determines the block size used by --llss and --ffllss.  If PPOOSSIIXXLLYY__CCOORRRREECCTT is set, blocks are units of  512
              bytes.  Otherwise they are units of 1024 bytes.

              Setting this variable also turns off warning messages (that is, implies --nnoowwaarrnn) by default, because
              POSIX requires that apart from the output for --ookk, all messages printed on  stderr  are  diagnostics
              and must result in a non-zero exit status.

              When  POSIXLY_CORRECT  is not set, --ppeerrmm +zzz is treated just like --ppeerrmm /zzz if +zzz is not a valid
              symbolic mode.  When POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, such constructs are treated as an error.

              When POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, the response to the prompt  made  by  the  --ookk  action  is  interpreted
              according  to the system's message catalogue, as opposed to according to ffiinndd's own message transla‐
              tions.


       TZ     Affects the time zone used for some of the time-related format directives of --pprriinnttff and --ffpprriinnttff.

       Find files named ccoorree in or below the directory //ttmmpp and delete them.  Note that this will work incorrectly
       if there are any filenames containing newlines, single or double quotes, or spaces.

       Find  files  named  ccoorree in or below the directory //ttmmpp and delete them, processing filenames in such a way
       that file or directory names containing single or double quotes, spaces or newlines are correctly  handled.
       The --nnaammee test comes before the --ttyyppee test in order to avoid having to call ssttaatt((22)) on every file.

       Runs `file' on every file in or below the current directory.  Notice that the braces are enclosed in single
       quote marks to protect them from interpretation as shell script punctuation.  The  semicolon  is  similarly
       protected by the use of a backslash, though single quotes could have been used in that case also.

       Traverse the filesystem just once, listing setuid files and directories into //rroooott//ssuuiidd..ttxxtt and large files
       into //rroooott//bbiigg..ttxxtt.


       ffiinndd $$HHOOMMEE --mmttiimmee 00

       Search for files in your home directory which have been modified in the last twenty-four hours.  This  com‐
       mand  works  this  way  because  the  time since each file was last modified is divided by 24 hours and any
       remainder is discarded.  That means that to match --mmttiimmee 00, a file will have to have a modification in  the
       past which is less than 24 hours ago.


       ffiinndd //ssbbiinn //uussrr//ssbbiinn --eexxeeccuuttaabbllee \\!! --rreeaaddaabbllee --pprriinntt

       Search for files which are executable but not readable.


       ffiinndd .. --ppeerrmm 666644

       Search for files which have read and write permission for their owner, and group, but which other users can
       read but not write to.  Files which meet these criteria but have other permissions bits set (for example if
       someone can execute the file) will not be matched.


       ffiinndd .. --ppeerrmm --666644

       Search  for files which have read and write permission for their owner and group, and which other users can
       read, without regard to the presence of any extra permission bits (for example the executable  bit).   This
       will match a file which has mode 0777, for example.


       ffiinndd .. --ppeerrmm //222222

       Search for files which are writable by somebody (their owner, or their group, or anybody else).


       ffiinndd .. --ppeerrmm //222200
       ffiinndd .. --ppeerrmm //uu++ww,,gg++ww
       ffiinndd .. --ppeerrmm //uu==ww,,gg==ww

       All  three of these commands do the same thing, but the first one uses the octal representation of the file
       mode, and the other two use the symbolic form.  These commands all search for files which are  writable  by
       either  their  owner or their group.  The files don't have to be writable by both the owner and group to be
       matched; either will do.


       ffiinndd .. --ppeerrmm --222200
       ffiinndd .. --ppeerrmm --gg++ww,,uu++ww

       Both these commands do the same thing; search for files which are writable by both their  owner  and  their
       group.


       ffiinndd .. --ppeerrmm --444444 --ppeerrmm //222222 !! --ppeerrmm //111111

       These  two commands both search for files that are readable for everybody ( --ppeerrmm --444444 or --ppeerrmm --aa++rr), have
       at least one write bit set ( --ppeerrmm //222222 or --ppeerrmm //aa++ww) but are not executable for anybody (  !!  --ppeerrmm  //111111
       and !! --ppeerrmm //aa++xx respectively).

       ccppiioo --ppmmdd00 //ddeesstt--ddiirr

       This  command copies the contents of //ssoouurrccee--ddiirr to //ddeesstt--ddiirr, but omits files and directories named ..ssnnaapp‐‐
       sshhoott (and anything in them).  It also omits files or directories whose name ends in ~~, but not  their  con‐
       tents.   The  construct  --pprruunnee --oo \\(( ...... --pprriinntt00 \\)) is quite common.  The idea here is that the expression
       before --pprruunnee matches things which are to be pruned.  However, the --pprruunnee action itself  returns  true,  so
       the  following --oo ensures that the right hand side is evaluated only for those directories which didn't get
       pruned (the contents of the pruned directories are not even visited, so  their  contents  are  irrelevant).
       The expression on the right hand side of the --oo is in parentheses only for clarity.  It emphasises that the
       --pprriinntt00 action takes place only for things that didn't have --pprruunnee applied to them.   Because  the  default
       `and'  condition  between tests binds more tightly than --oo, this is the default anyway, but the parentheses
       help to show what is going on.

       --pprriinntt --pprruunnee

       Given the following directory of projects and their associated SCM administrative directories,  perform  an
       efficient search for the projects' roots:

       rreeppoo//pprroojjeecctt11//CCVVSS

       rreeppoo//pprroojjeecctt44//..ggiitt

       In  this  example,  --pprruunnee  prevents unnecessary descent into directories that have already been discovered
       (for example we do not search project3/src because we already found  project3/.svn),  but  ensures  sibling
       directories (project2 and project3) are found.

       ffiinndd exits with status 0 if all files are processed successfully, greater than 0 if errors occur.   This is
       deliberately a very broad description, but if the return value is non-zero, you should not rely on the cor‐
       rectness of the results of ffiinndd.

       As of findutils-4.2.2, shell metacharacters (`*', `?' or `[]' for example) used in filename  patterns  will
       match a leading `.', because IEEE POSIX interpretation 126 requires this.

       The  syntax  --ppeerrmm  ++MMOODDEE  was  deprecated  in  findutils-4.2.21,  in  favour of --ppeerrmm //MMOODDEE.  As of findu‐
       tils-4.3.3, --ppeerrmm //000000 now matches all files instead of none.

       Nanosecond-resolution timestamps were implemented in findutils-4.3.3.

       As of findutils-4.3.11, the --ddeelleettee action sets ffiinndd's exit status to a nonzero value when it fails.   How‐
       ever,  ffiinndd  will  not  exit  immediately.  Previously, ffiinndd's exit status was unaffected by the failure of
       --ddeelleettee.

       $$ ffiinndd .. --nnaammee **..cc --pprriinntt
       find: paths must precede expression
       Usage: find [-H] [-L] [-P] [-Olevel] [-D help|tree|search|stat|rates|opt|exec] [path...] [expression]

       This happens because _*_._c has been expanded by the shell resulting in ffiinndd actually receiving a command line
       like this:

       ffiinndd .. --nnaammee bbiiggrraamm..cc ccooddee..cc ffrrccooddee..cc llooccaattee..cc --pprriinntt

       That command is of course not going to work.  Instead of doing things this way, you should enclose the pat‐
       tern in quotes or escape the wildcard:
       $$ ffiinndd .. --nnaammee \\**..cc --pprriinntt


BBUUGGSS
       There are security problems inherent in the behaviour that the POSIX standard  specifies  for  ffiinndd,  which
       therefore  cannot  be  fixed.  For example, the --eexxeecc action is inherently insecure, and --eexxeeccddiirr should be
       used instead.  Please see FFiinnddiinngg FFiilleess for more information.

       The environment variable LLCC__CCOOLLLLAATTEE has no effect on the --ookk action.

       The best way to report a bug is to use the form at http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=findutils.  The rea‐
       son  for this is that you will then be able to track progress in fixing the problem.   Other comments about
       ffiinndd(1) and about the findutils package in general can be sent to the _b_u_g_-_f_i_n_d_u_t_i_l_s mailing list.  To  join
       the list, send email to _b_u_g_-_f_i_n_d_u_t_i_l_s_-_r_e_q_u_e_s_t_@_g_n_u_._o_r_g.
